# Billing

## Managing Your Subscription

Plans are billed monthly, beginning on the date subscribed to the service and recurring monthly on that same date. You can view your plan renewal date on your [accounts page](https://peepostream.com/account).

### Upgrading

#### Upgrading From Free Tier

You can upgrade your peepoStream account anytime by clicking the upgrade button at the top of the dashboard. This button will take you to the [store page](https://peepostream.com/store), where you can select the best plan for you. See the [plans](#plans) section below for an in-depth look at each.

#### Upgrading From Based Tier

Navigate to your [accounts page](https://peepostream.com/account), and click “Manage Billing”. Within the billing dashboard, click the green “Update Plan” button. Then, follow the checkout flow to upgrade your subscription.

### Downgrading

It is currently impossible to automatically downgrade peepoStream accounts at the end of a billing cycle. If you would like to downgrade your plan, navigate to the [accounts page](https://peepostream.com/account), click “Manage Billing”, then “Cancel Plan” to end your subscription. The benefits of your current tier will continue to apply for the rest of the billing period. After this, you will return to the Essentials plan. You can then [upgrade your plan](#upgrading) as usual.

### Cancelling

We’re sorry peepoStream didn’t meet your needs! To help us improve peepoStream you can submit a reason for the cancellation. If you want to cancel your subscription, you can do so from your [Account Page](https://peepostream.com/account). Just click the “Manage Billing” button at the bottom of your current tier overview. Then, click the white “Cancel Plan” button on the billing dashboard.
