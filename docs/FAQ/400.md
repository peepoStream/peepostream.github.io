# Twitch Error 400 Bad Request

</div>

This is a Twitch error, meaning something on their end is blocking the request. The two primary causes of this are:

1. A reward with that name already exists on your channel, including disabled rewards.
2. The reward name or description contains a word Twitch doesn't like.

Changing the reward title usually resolves this error.
