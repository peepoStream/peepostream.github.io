# TTS Everything

:::caution
For TTS Everything to play you need to setup the [Chat Features browser source](/setup/chat/setup).
:::

For TTS Everything to start working, you will need to enable the feature on the [TTS Dashboard](https://peepostream.com/tts). From here you can also manage the voice used, the volume, and wether or not the chatter's name should be read before each message. The selected voice will apply to both TTS Everything and the [TTS Chat Command](/setup/chat/command).

After this, any message sent will be read out in the selected voice

:::info
Messages read count towards your [Monthly Quota](/account/billing#plans), and it is not possible to use AI voices with TTS Everything.
