# Payouts

## Payment Split
Revenue from bits spent inside a Twitch Extension are split between the the extension developer (us) and the streamer (you).
Streamers receive 80% of each bit payment and the developer receives 20%. This is set by Twitch and cannot be changed.

## How do I get paid?
You can see the revenue from extensions by going to your [Earnings Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/analytics/revenue-earnings) and looking at the "Revenue Sources" panel. It will be labelled under "Extensions"

This revenue will be sent in your usual monthly Twitch Payout.
