# TTS Rewards

There are two types of TTS in peepoStream, Standard and AI.

## Standard TTS

Standard TTS is a type of TTS that can be used in both TTS Everything and Channel Rewards. These voices render much faster and more accurately than AI TTS. Every time a message is sent through channel points or TTS Everything, one message will be taken off your [Monthly Quota](/docs/account/billing#plans), which you can see both in the Dock and on your [Account Page](https://peepostream.com/account). Both paid plans come with unlimited Standard TTS.

## AI TTS

AI TTS can only be used in Channel Point rewards due to the longer processing time required for each message. Every time a message is sent through channel points or TTS Everything, one message will be taken off your [Monthly Quota](/docs/account/billing#plans), which you can see both in the Dock and on your [Account Page](https://peepostream.com/account).
