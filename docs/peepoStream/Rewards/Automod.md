# Moderating Rewards

## Blocking Words or Phrases

Because peepoStream requests are sent through Twitch Channel Points, Twitch's AutoMod will automatically apply your stream moderation filters to peepoStream alerts.

### Managing Automod

To add or remove blocked words and phrases, navigate to your [Twitch Moderation Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/settings/moderation). From here, you can manage your AutoMod Rulesets, Blocked Terms and Phrases, and more.

:::tip
We recommend going through your AutoMod rules first, as they are helpful for automatically adding many of the most commonly blocked words.
:::

Add your blocked terms under "Blocked Terms and Phrases". The privacy settings for blocked terms will not affect enforcement.
Please see this Twitch support article for further information about AutoMod:
