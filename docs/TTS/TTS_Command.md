# TTS Command

For the TTS Command to start working, you will need to enable the feature on the [TTS Dashboard](https://peepostream.com/tts). From here you can also manage the voice used and whether or not the chatter's name should be read before each message. The selected voice will apply to both [TTS Everything](/tts/ttse) and the TTS Chat Command.

After this, any message sent with `~tts` at the start will be read out in the selected voice.

:::info
Messages read count towards your [Monthly Quota](/account/billing#plans), and it is not currently possible to use AI voices with the TTS Command. The prefix `~tts` cannot currently be changed.
