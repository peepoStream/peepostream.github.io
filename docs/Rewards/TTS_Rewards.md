# TTS Rewards

There are two types of TTS in peepoStream, Standard and AI. This article is about the details of each, to create a reward using TTS, see [Creating a Reward](/rewards/create).

## Standard TTS

Standard TTS is a type of TTS that can be used in both TTS Everything and Channel Rewards. These voices render much faster and more accurately than AI TTS. Every time a message is sent through channel points or TTS Everything, one message will be taken off your [Monthly Quota](/account/billing#plans). You can see your remaining message count both on the Dock and on your [Account Page](https://peepostream.com/account). Both paid plans come with unlimited Standard TTS.

## AI TTS

AI TTS can only be used in Channel Point rewards due to the longer processing time required for each message. Every time a message is sent through channel points, one message will be taken off your [Monthly Quota](/account/billing#plans). You can see your remaining message count both on the Dock and on your [Account Page](https://peepostream.com/account).
