# Mod Actions

## Ban / Timeout

The user will be prompted to enter the username of any non-moderator to be temporarily timed out.
The timeout duration can be customized on a per-reward basis. The default duration is 60 seconds.
:::note
You can immediately end any user's timeout by overwriting it. The command below will overwrite any existing timeout with a single-second timeout.

```text
/timeout username 1
```

:::

## VIP

The redeemer of the reward will be given the VIP role.  
:::caution
VIPs are unaffected by slow, sub-only, and follower-only modes. They can also post links in chat *even when links are disabled in your moderation settings*.
:::
:::info
The amount of VIPs on a channel at any given time is limited by your progress on the "[Build a Community](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/analytics/achievements)" achievementâ€”the number of VIPs scales per unique chatters in a stream, up to 100 VIPs max. See the table below for details.
